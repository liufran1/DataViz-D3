    <div id="paragraph1">
      One of the first things I noticed when traveling around Vietnam and
      Southeast Asia broadly is that people love their motorbikes

      With a population of nearly 100M people and growing, I wanted to
      understand what is the impact of all these motorbikes on the environment,
      society, and how will this change in the coming years as Vietnam becomes
      richer and our planet gets hotter?

      Vietnam has experienced rapid population growth and economic development
      through the end of the 20th century and into the 21st

      It has gone from 70 million people to 100 million in just the last 30
      years

    <div id="macro_perspective_3">
      The country has experienced exponential economic growth, and consequently
      carbon emissions have come along for the ride

      As the population and economy has grown, so has motorbike ownership

      What has been the impact of all these motorbikes on carbon emissions and
      air pollution?

    <div id="emissions_1">
      Coming from the United States, where transportation is the second largest
      source of carbon emissions, my initial instinct was to wonder how much
      this visible traffic impacted Vietnam's environment

      If we look at the air quality in Hanoi in 2023, 306 days exceeded the WHO

      We see the health impact of high pollution levels in the death statistics.
      Air pollution is the third highest cause of death in Vietnam - footnote:
      for an in-depth look at air pollution and its impact on human health, this
      article goes into much more detail:

      The country is quickly urbanizing - can it improve its urban air quality
      fast enough to keep up with its population streaming into its cities?

      How has Vietnam responded? The Euro 2 equivalent emissions standard came
      in force for motorbikes in 2007, and Euro 3 standard implemented in 2017.
      However, as of 2024, while the Euro 5 guidelines apply to all new cars
      sold since 2022 -

      motorbikes are still regulated under Euro 3 standards, with Euro 4 level
      standards published but not mandatory. Neither the Euro 2 nor Euro 3
      standard regulates particulate matter pollution
