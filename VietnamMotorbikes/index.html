            If we expand beyond just CO2 to look at air pollution broadly,
            transportation still dominates, especially if we focus in on cities.
            A 2020 study of Ho Chi Minh City attributed 95% of air pollution to
            transportation sources, with trucks, cars, or motorbikes dominating
